
-- Running the test cases

Cassini should be installed on your machine in order to
run the tests. Just use nant:

  > nant -t:net-1.1

to compile and test everything


-- Scaffolding

The scaffolding support tests requires a database. The schema is created automatically.
See the "How to build.txt" file at the root of the repository for details.
