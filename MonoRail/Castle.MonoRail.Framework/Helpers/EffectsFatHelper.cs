	/// <summary>
	/// Just apply the CSS class "fade" to any element and it will fade from yellow
	/// to its background color or white if none is specified.
	/// 
	/// Key Features
	/// * Fade an infinite number of elements.
	/// * No inline JavaScript. Simply give an element a class of "fade", the script does the rest "automagically".
	/// * Background color aware. FAT will do better than simply fade to white if the element (or it's parents) have a CSS background color, it will fade to that background color instead.
	/// * Fade from any color. For example, if you wanted a list of error messages to fade out from red you would simply give the list a class of "fade-FF0000".
	/// * Super smooth fading. By default, elements will fade at 30 frames per second (the same rate as a television) over 3 seconds. You can adjust this to any framerate and any duration. You could easily fade elements at 60 frames per second over 4, 5, 10 seconds!
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// NOTE: All elements to be faded must have an id tag!
	/// BASIC USE: <p id="paragraph1" class="fade">Watch me fade</p>
	/// ADVANCED USE: Change the default fade from color:
	/// <p id="paragraph1" class="fade-0066FF">Watch me fade from Blue (#0066FF)</p>
