
Keep tracking of what's on my brain:

- There's currently enough of semantics to go on beyond parser and lexer

- The next step is to populate the NamingScopes

- Then build a better AST (closer to what is going to be actually compiled)

- Finally emit the textual IL at first and compile it using ilasm
