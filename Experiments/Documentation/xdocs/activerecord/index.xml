<p>
Castle ActiveRecord is an implementation of the ActiveRecord pattern for .NET. 
The ActiveRecord pattern consists on instance methods and properties 
representing rows in the database, and static methods acting on all rows.
</p>
<p>
Castle ActiveRecord is built on top of NHibernate, but its attribute-based 
mapping frees the developer of writing XML for database-to-object mapping, 
which is needed when using NHibernate directly. For more information please refer
to ActiveRecord:Getting started
