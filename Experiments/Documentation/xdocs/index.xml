<title>The Number One HTTP Server On The Internet</title>

<p>The Apache HTTP Server Project is an effort to develop and maintain
an open-source HTTP server for modern operating systems including UNIX
and Windows NT. The goal of this project is to provide a secure,
efficient and extensible server that provides HTTP services in sync
with the current HTTP standards.</p>

<p>Apache has been the most popular web server on the Internet since
April 1996.  The November 2005 <a 
href="http://news.netcraft.com/archives/web_server_survey.html">Netcraft Web Server Survey</a>
found that more than 70% of the web sites on the Internet are using Apache,
thus making it more widely used than all other web servers combined.</p>

<p>The Apache HTTP Server is a project of the <a
href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache Software Foundation</a>.</p>
