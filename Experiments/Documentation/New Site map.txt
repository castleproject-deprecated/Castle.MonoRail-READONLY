IRC discussion:
[13:28] <goodenough> I think we have to slice up the project as a whole into the audiences we are trying to serve.
[13:28] <hammett> they have put together a nice tutorial on how to create patches and work on the docs
[13:28] <goodenough> Oh really? That sounds interesting.
[13:29] <goodenough> I have never been dilligent enough about documentation and am taking my learning castle as a way to improve those skills.
[13:29] <goodenough> It would be great to have it all very fine tuned.
[13:30] <hammett> about audience
[13:31] <hammett> you mean nwecomers, beginners, intermediate and advanced?
[13:31] <hammett> because castle is a project from developers to developers
[13:31] <goodenough> Yes. Also, why are they looking at the project.
[13:31] <hammett> or do you mean business people, managers and developers?
[13:31] <hammett> ok, got it;
[13:31] <goodenough> In some cases the devs will be able to use Castle without letting on, but it may come down to them having to make the pitch to the big guys.
[13:32] <goodenough> And we can have some executive over-view docs (that don't need to be as current with the code) to help out.
[13:33] <goodenough> It makes sense to break the docs up by subproject. That way each part of the documentation can be focused on the subject matter.
[13:33] <hammett> another thing I've though, docbook is too restrictive
[13:34] <hammett> I'd rather use some xml/xsl but no docbook. have you used it?
[13:34] <goodenough> That being said, we also need to address that all of these parts can be used together in various ways - some help with how that happens, why you would want to do it, and the technical details of implemenation.
[13:34] <goodenough> I haven't used it.


TO DO: 
- Find out a way to set the audience target and difficult level of each article.
- Link documentation pages with a Back and Next navigation. Keep each page as small as possible
- Add pages on "troubleshooting" and "how to report bugs"

MicroKernel / Windsor 

  MicroKernel lightweight. Useful for selfcontained applications/tools like compiler, embedded architectures with replaceable components

  Windsor: more robust implementation: Satisfy common enterprise application needs. Adds a complete and powerful support for external configuration.
