Everything should compile fine using NAnt 0.85 RC3. Anyway, the following are some useful tips if things go wrong for some reason.
  

Where to start the build?
=========================

Use the all.build in the root directory. It compiles everything in the right order, copies dependencies and so on. 


Building for .Net 2.0
=====================

Some of the Castle components has additional features that require the .Net 2.0 framework. 
If you want to use Castle on a project that runs the .Net 2.0 framework, you should make sure that you're
building for .Net 2.0
Usually it will happen automatically if the .Net 2.0 is installed on your computer, but you can make sure by specifying
the 2.0 version like so:
  
  > nant -t:net-2.0

Database tests
==============

If you have MS SQL Server installed, just create two databases:

- test
- test2

If not you must adjust the connection string and create a small structure on your data. To avoid all this aggravation, simply disable it:

  > nant -D:nhibernate.test=false -D:activerecord.test=false


The basic NHibernate settings can be set as NAnt arguments:

- ar.dialect sets the NHibernate dialect

    > -D:ar.dialect=NHibernate.Dialect.MsSql2000Dialect

- ar.connection.driver_class sets the driver

    > -D:ar.connection.driver_class=NHibernate.Driver.SqlClientDriver

- ar.connection.connection_string{1,2} set the connection strings for the test and test2 databases

    > -D:ar.connection.connection_string.1="Data Source=.\sqlexpress;Initial Catalog=test;Integrated Security=SSPI;"
    > -D:ar.connection.connection_string.2="Data Source=.\sqlexpress;Initial Catalog=test2;Integrated Security=SSPI;"



MonoRail tests are failing
==========================

Not good. If you have more than one CLR runtime installed, try specifying the 1.1 runtime:

  > nant -t:net-1.1

If the problem persists, just disable the MonoRail tests:
  
  > nant -D:monorail.test=false


Build options
=============

Compiling a Debug version
-------------------------

  > nant -D:debug=true -D:optimize=false

Compiling a version not strongly signed
---------------------------------------

  > nant -D:strong=false
