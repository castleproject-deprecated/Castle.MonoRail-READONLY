Everything should compile fine using NAnt 0.85 RC3. Anyway, the following are some useful tips if things go wrong for some reason.


- Where to start the build?

Use the all.build in the root directory. It compiles everything in the right order, copies dependencies and so on. 


- MonoRail tests are failing

Not good. If you have more than one CLR runtime installed, try specifying the 1.1 runtime:

  > nant -t:net-1.1

If the problem persists, just disable the MonoRail tests:
  
  > nant -D:monorail.test=false


- NHibernate Facility

This test is bound to fail. You must adjust the connection string and create a small structure on your data. To avoid all this aggravation, simply disable it:

> nant -D:nhibernate.test=false

- ActiveRecord
