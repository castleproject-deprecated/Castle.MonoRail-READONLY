#
# This is a simple example of a velocity properties file.
#
# Any property that is not listed here will have it's default
# value used.  The default values are located in :
#  *  src/NVelocity/Runtime/Default/nvelocity.defaults
#  *  http://jakarta.apache.org/velocity/developer-guide.html
#
# as an example, we are changing the name of the log file
#
runtime.log = nvelocity_example1.log
