::ToDo
----------
- move ResourceLocator to Commons package
- move SupportClass to Commons package
- move StringUtils to Commons package
- ?bug? - when generating xdocs for site, if template caching is not on, sometimes the #document() gets parsed as ASTDirective and ASTText with "()" in it.
- cleanup doc comments all over the place - make sure they still make sense for the ported code
- remove the code stuff that is in the /src directory
- write test that can call both the Java and C# versions of the AST Parser to make sure that both parse templates exactly the same.
- evaluate use of streams

::ToDone
----------
- consider making all NAnt tasks in a seperate package (and moving Dvsl into the core package?)
- ViewServlet from Tools subproject - needed for Maverick.net
- figure out how to be able to pass a category and an appdomain across appdomain boundries.
	    // use the logger category from this class to initialize NVelocity
	    log4net.ILog logger = log4net.LogManager.GetLogger(CATEGORY_NAME);
	    logger.Info("Initializing logging category for NVelocity");
	    Velocity.SetProperty("runtime.log.logsystem.log4net.category", CATEGORY_NAME);
	** use runtime.log.logsystem.log4net.category to set the category for logging.  NVelocity uses the default log domain and should be able to join whatever logger is setup.
- update to NUnit 2.1
