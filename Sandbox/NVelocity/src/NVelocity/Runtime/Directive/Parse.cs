	/// <summary> Pluggable directive that handles the #parse() statement in VTL.
	/// *
	/// Notes:
	/// -----
	/// 1) The parsed source material can only come from somewhere in
	/// the TemplateRoot tree for security reasons. There is no way
	/// around this.  If you want to include content from elsewhere on
	/// your disk, use a link from somwhere under Template Root to that
	/// content.
	/// *
	/// 2) There is a limited parse depth.  It is set as a property
	/// "parse_directive.maxdepth = 10"  for example.  There is a 20 iteration
	/// safety in the event that the parameter isn't set.
