
+ Change TypeDeclarationExpression to something else - its not really an expression

  This affects the parser rules:

    type_name_withtype
    type_name

  They could return a kind of TypeName/VariableReference  (identifier + type name)

  DONE!!!


+ Redesign the AST, maybe instead of just "statements" group things by their meaning:

  TypeDeclaration
    StaticFieldsDeclarations
    FieldsDeclarations
    Constructors
    StaticMethod
    Methods

  MethodDefinition
    FormalParameters
    Locals


  Scope/NamingContainer
    subclasses:
      FileUnit (see below)
      Namespace
      TypeDeclaration
      MethodDefinition
      Block
      Compound


+ Add another level of abstraction to represent a file

  CompilationUnit 
    FileUnit/SourceUnit
      Namespaces/TypeDeclarations  


+ Support unary exp CAST and ISA and AS

  x = (int) something

  x = something is int

  x = something as int
