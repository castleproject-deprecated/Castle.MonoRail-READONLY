Source code zip file from the build server
==========================================

If you have downloaded the Castle source code from the build server as a zip file, you will not be able to build Castle using this source.

The source code is provided in this package from the build server only so you can load source into Visual Studio when debugging with the symbols.

If you want to build Castle you will need to checkout the source from subversion and see "How to build.txt" for details.
