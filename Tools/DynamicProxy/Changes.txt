
- Applied brian@protexis.com suggestion to fix bug. Quoting "When the GetMethods call is 
  made on the Type object, the returned array of Method objects do not nessessarily 
  belong to the same Assembly object as the Type object.

  Consequently, the line ....

  if (method.IsAssembly && !IsInternalToDynamicProxy(inter.Assembly))

  should be ...

  if (method.IsAssembly && !IsInternalToDynamicProxy(method.Module.Assembly))

  For example,

    - There are two assemblies AssemblyA and AssemblyB
    - AssemblyA does NOT expose its internals to DynamicAssemblyProxyGen
    - AssemblyB does expose its internals to DynamicAssemblyProxyGen
    - ClassA belongs to AssemblyA
    - ClassB belongs to AssemblyB
    - ClassA has a method MethodA whoses protection level is 'internal'
    - ClassB subclasses ClassA

  When the current implementation of DynamicProxy attempts to create an instance 
  of ClassB, it fails because it tries to create MethodA when it does not have access to it. "



- Applied Dragos Nuta <dragos.nuta@uti.ro> patch correcting the usage of ReaderWriter lock
  
- Fixed DYNPROXY-22 - Can't handle `char' type in Interface Proxy

Version 1.4.8

 * Added generic type detection, to avoid a case where types with the same generic type but with deferent parameters were treated the same
 * Added nested types detection, to avoid a case were types foo.Bar and Bar are treated the same

Version 1.4.7

 * Added support for producing signed assmeblies when the proxied type is signed (solve some problems with proxies for strongly named internal classes on .Net 2.0).
   Usage is: [assembly: InternalsVisibleTo("DynamicAssemblyProxyGen, PublicKey=0024000004800000940000000602000000240000525341310004000001000100fb4ff5a7c8bba6feb6a6b75b260cd57c1b8b85b63a45dedcb7081331740c870852af30abd2a74700cce1d7a01aeed019339db202e010ac808396b2922362877c6afc8993281092434a223b9920cac8ba409d138a97b73cd1baad813af450b886e3d7f5a09ee450d415145eb0524778a6bd1ae733fd2b6ceebfd151620534bcb7")]
Version 1.4.6

 * Fixed a problem with overloaded indexed properties
 * Added ability to handle internal classes using .Net 2 InternalsVisibleTo
 * Removed trace warning when method is not found on object.
 * Applied patch from Jeff Brown <Jeff@ingenio.com> to support ref and out params.

Version 1.0.6
- Applied patch from Corneliu I. Tusnea

Version 1.0.5
- Fix sbyte enums

Version 1.0.4
- Added the property MethodInvocationTarget to the IInvocation interface.
  This property represents the methods being invoked on the target object. This
  is important when proxying interfaces and still you want to obtain attributes
  from the method on the concrete class.

Version 1.0.3
- Applied patch from Sergey Koshcheyev related to proxy desserialization problems

Version 1.0.2
- Support for constructor arguments
- Lock implemented on the obtention of the invocation objects (also multithread test case added)
- Applied patch from Mark Traudt to make SimpleAST support the creation of events

Version 1.0.0
- First release
