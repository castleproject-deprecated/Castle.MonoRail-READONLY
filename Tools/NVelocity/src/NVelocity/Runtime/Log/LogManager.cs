	/// This class is responsible for instantiating the correct LoggingSystem
	/// </p>
	/// <p>
	/// The approach is :
	/// </p>
	/// <ul>
	/// <li>
	/// First try to see if the user is passing in a living object
	/// that is a LogSystem, allowing the app to give is living
	/// custom loggers.
	/// </li>
	/// <li>
	/// Next, run through the (possible) list of classes specified
	/// specified as loggers, taking the first one that appears to
	/// work.  This is how we support finding either log4j or
	/// logkit, whichever is in the classpath, as both are
	/// listed as defaults.
	/// </li>
	/// <li>
	/// Finally, we turn to 'faith-based' logging, and hope that
	/// logkit is in the classpath, and try for an AvalonLogSystem
	/// as a final gasp.  After that, there is nothing we can do.
	/// </li>
	/// </ul>
