Beta 1 Version 1.0.0.0
======================

- Applied Fabian Schmied's patch fixing the deserialization without default constructors issue (DYNPROXY-53)

- Added property and event support for mixins (expanding Ayendes initial work).

- Moved the UseSingleInterfaceProxy from Core.ComponentModel to ProxyGeneratorOptions. 

- Applied Lee Henson's patch fixing generic parameter definitions

- Applied Jacob Lewallen's patch that introduces ProxyInterfaceWithTargetInterface
  Quoting

  "I've introduced a new "mode" that is
   ProxyInterfaceWithTargetInterface, that uses the given interface as
   the target type, rather than the type of the target (it asserts the
   target implements the interface) All other modes should remain the
   same.

  "In this scenario, the IInvocation will also implement
   IChangeProxyTarget, which can then be used to change the proxy target
   to another implementation of the target interface."

- Added support for events
