The AR project was created for you, and it is meant to 
hold ActiveRecord types only (as it is a class library). 
You should reference it from the projects that actually
use the domain model.

Remember that it is up to the project that uses it 
(like a web project, or desktop app) to initialize
the ActiveRecord framework using ActiveRecordStarter.

More information on configuration and initialization 
can be found on the documentation.


Enjoy
