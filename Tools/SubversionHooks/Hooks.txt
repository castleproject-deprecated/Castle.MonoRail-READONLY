	args[0] - Repository Path, used with svnlook
	args[1] - The user that is attempting to commit

pre-commit	(transaction)
	args[0] - Repository Path, used with svnlook
	args[1] - Transaction (format \d+-\d+)
post-commit	(revision)
	args[0] - Repository Path, used with svnlook
	args[1] - Revision (format \d+)
	
	
pre-lock	(path, user)
	args[0] - Repository Path, used with svnlook
	args[1] - Path inside the repository
	args[2] - The user creating the lock
post-lock	(user)
	args[0] - Repository Path, used with svnlook
	args[1] - The user that created the lock
	The paths that were just locked are passed in through stdin	
	
pre-unlock	(path, user)
	args[0] - Repository Path, used with svnlook
	args[1] - Path inside the repository
	args[2] - The user destroying the lock
post-unlock	(user)
	args[0] - Repository Path, used with svnlook
	args[1] - The user that destroyed the lock
	The paths that were just unlocked are passed in through stdin


pre-revprop-change	(revision, user, propname, action)
	[STDIN] PROPVAL  ** the new property value is passed via STDIN.
	Note that pre-revprop-change is different from all other hooks,
	if it does not exist Subversion behaves as if it did and failed,
	this is because these changes are not versioned and can thus be
	destructive.
post-revprop-change	(revision, user, propname, action)
	[STDIN] PROPVAL  ** the old property value is passed via STDIN.
