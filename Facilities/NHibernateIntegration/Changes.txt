Version beta 3

- Removed RegisterSessionFactory from ISessionManager

- Used https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/cuyahoga/trunk/Core/Facilities/ as inspiration
  to add support for rebuildable session factories
 
- You can now control the NH's ReflectionOptimizer through the attribute useReflectionOptimizer which goes on the facility node.

- The DefaultSessionManager will always look up for a component "nhibernate.session.interceptor" to use as
  a NH Interceptor
  
- The NH Facility will always look up for a component "nhibernate.sessionfactory.interceptor" and 
  associate the instance with the Configuration.Interceptor before creating the session factories
