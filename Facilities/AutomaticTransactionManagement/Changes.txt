- Fixed bug reported on the Forum (when a
  component was configured using the component's node, no interceptor
  was being attached)

- Refactored to support configuration and attributes. For example

  [Transactional]
  public class MyTransactionalComponent
  {
    [Transaction]
    public virtual void Save()
    {
    }
  }
  
  is equivalent to 
  
  <component 
	id="someid" 
	type="MyTransactionalComponent, MyAssembly"
	isTransactional="true">
  
    <transaction>
      <method name="Save" />
    </transaction>
  
  </component>

  You can also specify the transaction mode and isolation:
  
  <transaction>
    <method name="Save" transactionMode="Requires" isolationLevel="Chaos" />
  </transaction>
